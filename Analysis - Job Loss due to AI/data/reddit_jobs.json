I was a top contributor on my team, and also the only female on the team for the past three years, a team which had changed focus and processes drastically (and we changed with it) since the last female had left. I got passed up for a promotion in early 2024, which really rocked me to my core.  I had several years more seniority than the two males who were promoted, and all of my coworkers were shocked that I hadn\u2019t been promoted.  I had just had a stellar annual review just prior to the promotion, and had been told there was room for upward growth for me at this company in the future, there was recognition of how hard I worked for the team, appreciation of my effort, etc etc - work LESS, they said (not in my ethic, sorry) but keep in mind it was a startup and those formative years of effort (not just mine, but all of our team members) helped MAKE that company, and I was willing to give a large portion of my life to that job and that company, to make it payoff for them, so I did - hoping one day it would pay off for me and I would advance within the company.\n\nSo, we get to the promotions, which were announced in a company call (cue shock, as I was waiting for my name to be called, and it never was, not sure was my name ever even in the hat for promotion, from what I can tell) and shortly after, it was at this point (feeling betrayed, tbh) that I started to experience burnout, and, at the suggestion of my boss (who was going through his own personal struggles at the time), pursued mental health counseling through a 3rd party service my employer offered as a resource. \n\nMy therapist at that 3rd party provider helped me to see the signs of burnout I was experiencing, and suggested I pursue FMLA leave, something I didn\u2019t even know was possible for the burnout (mainly manifested by severe anxiety and cyclical depression).  Through the help of my GP, I took 6 weeks of FMLA leave to try to clear my head and see if I could get past the feelings of betrayal and the toxic culture my company had started presenting in the last year.   \n\nWhen I came back, it was evident that there was no care for me or anything I had been going through while I had been out on leave.  I was basically ignored for weeks as I tried to catch up on big changes that had been announced during my leave, no one \u201cchecked in\u201d to see how I was doing, the little interaction I recorded from the team included being belittled by my boss for asking questions about new changes, etc etc.  \n\nAbout three weeks to the DAY I returned from this 6 weeks of FMLA leave, I had a meeting with my boss\u2019s boss appear on my calendar (also, this was on a Thursday at 5pm, scheduled for the next morning [Friday] at 10AM or so), called \u201c[his name] / [my name] check in\u201d.   This was not a person who would ever schedule a meeting with me or \u201ccheck in\u201d on me.  I grimly joked to my husband that perhaps I would be fired. No one else was invited on the meeting.  That next morning, as I joined the meeting, I saw that an HR representative had been added to the meeting since I had received the meeting invite.  In less than 5 minutes, my boss\u2019s boss thanked me for my years of contribution to the company, and informed me that I had come \u201ccome to the end of the road\u201d in my employment with the company, and the company \u201cwished to part ways with me.\u201d That was it, and he disconnected from the call.  The HR person asked if I had any questions, and I told her I had SO many questions - why, what did I do, and she was unable to answer any of them.  She told me that my dismissal was due to job related performance, but I had had no warning or indication of any job related performance issues.   Again, the entire \u201cfiring\u201d took less than 5 minutes, including my short, unhelpful conversation with HR, who was less than supportive following that conversation.  I was booted from all company access within about 15 minutes, and I managed to save copies of my employee reviews before the system shut down, in case they tried to alter past reviews later (I wouldn\u2019t put it past them). \n\nThey wanted me to sign an NDA, and take a bailout payment of a couple months salary, and I refused to sign it (may have been stupid on my part) because I felt they were trying to silence me.  I walked away from all of stock options, and basically left empty handed.  They told the rest of the company that I had left the company, and made it sound like I had chosen to pursue other avenues.  \n\nI went on unemployment for a couple of months, but it was difficult and humiliating to keep up with, and I ended up starting my own small business and have been working at that ever since.   I am still devastated by what feels like career homicide, struggling emotionally and financially (and have been for over a year), and I just feel like it\u2019s not right, even in at will employment position, to dump someone off a cliff as a sacrifice for struggling with mental health after giving so much to a company.  I\u2019m not a legal eagle or a Google lawyer, but something tells me this could be borderline illegal, and I haven\u2019t been able to find anyone worth their salt to hear my story (but I\u2019ve been so ashamed and disgusted by it all that I bury my head in the sand and keep putting one foot in front of the other, every day, to stay sane).  I don\u2019t know where to look or who to contact for help, and if I pursue anything legally, I only have until summer of next year to file a claim.\n\nCan anyone help point me in the right direction? Thank you SO much for reading - if you got this far, I could hug you, because the pain of losing my career without explanation (and the devastation of feeling like I can\u2019t get back into the game because I\u2019m TERRIFIED to work for people or companies who can take my BEST efforts and rip them to pieces / upheave my entire life, like this) has been nearly unbearable.  \n\nI feel like I have suffered some pretty grave emotional disturbances from this whole ordeal, such as worse anxiety/depression (had to go on three more meds for anxiety / depression / mood stabilization), worsened insomnia, weight gain and increased debt, and IF this company did anything illegal in letting me go as retaliation for taking necessary leave under a federally protected act, I want them held responsible and I do not want them to treat anyone else like this and get sent with it.  TW - I considered suicide several times when this first happened, because it didn\u2019t make sense but the shame was so great.  I\u2019ve been in recovery from alcohol for years, and this triggered me big time, but I\u2019ve continued to stay sober to this day and am grateful for multiple years of sobriety and the tools of the program to try and get past this, just to survive.\n\n\nEmotional/\u201cbig feewings\u201d contributions to this mess - \nThere is so much more to this story, including a diagnosis of ADHD in the last year (new meds, new hang ups, but never lost steam towards company goals), also going through a cancer scare earlier that same year (a little bit of what contributed to the burnout), and later finding it that my (married) boss was engaging in inappropriate relationships/an affair with another female employee who was a direct report to him (NOT me - she disclosed this to me after the fact, after she left the company voluntarily and after I was let go, but I am starting to see how he finally realized I wasn\u2019t going to worship him or fall into the same trap, and that he was losing his influence over me)\u2026 \n\nthis all contributed to my slow \u201cfalling out\u201d with him as I watched him change from a humble leader who I would\u2019ve almost considered a mentor and would\u2019ve \u201cprofessionally\u201d followed to the ends of the earth, to an alcohol-abusing shell of a person consumed by power, influence and salary, consistently disrespectful to anyone who disagreed with him, 99% of which were other females (and many of us went to HR about it, to no avail)\u2026 \n\nthis same person (again, my direct boss) KNEW I was in recovery from alcohol and encouraged me to drink at multiple work events over the years, which I never did\u2026 he would drunk text me at night (I have pictures of this), he put out pro-alcohol messages to our entire team, literally showing him drinking bourbon and MMM-mmm-mmming how good they were, literally said \u201cdon\u2019t you wish you had some\u201d in a video where he was drinking - not only as these triggerish for someone in recovery from alcohol, they are also just inappropriate in general in the workplace, I believe. \n\nI suspect, in the end, that he was frustrated that he was falling victim to the drink and I had found a way out, and miserable people don\u2019t like people with a solution\u2026 but these are just my thoughts. \n\nI\u2019m sorry this post turned out so long. Again, ANY thoughts or help pointers would be so gratefully appreciated.

I am still devastated by what feels like career homicide, struggling emotionally and financially (and have been for over a year), and I just feel like it\u2019s not right, even in at will employment position, to dump someone off a cliff as a sacrifice for struggling with mental health after giving so much to a company.  I\u2019m not a legal eagle or a Google lawyer, but something tells me this could be borderline illegal, and I haven\u2019t been able to find anyone worth their salt to hear my story (but I\u2019ve been so ashamed and disgusted by it all that I bury my head in the sand and keep putting one foot in front of the other, every day, to stay sane).  I don\u2019t know where to look or who to contact for help, and if I pursue anything legally, I only have until summer of next year to file a claim.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Can anyone help point me in the right direction? Thank you SO much for reading - if you got this far, I could hug you, because the pain of losing my career without explanation (and the devastation of feeling like I can\u2019t get back into the game because I\u2019m TERRIFIED to work for people or companies who can take my BEST efforts and rip them to pieces / upheave my entire life, like this) has been nearly unbearable.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I feel like I have suffered some pretty grave emotional disturbances from this whole ordeal, such as worse anxiety/depression (had to go on three more meds for anxiety / depression / mood stabilization), worsened insomnia, weight gain and increased debt, and IF this company did anything illegal in letting me go as retaliation for taking necessary leave under a federally protected act, I want them held responsible and I do not want them to treat anyone else like this and get sent with it.  TW - I considered suicide several times when this first happened, because it didn\u2019t make sense but the shame was so great.  I\u2019ve been in recovery from alcohol for years, and this triggered me big time, but I\u2019ve continued to stay sober to this day and am grateful for multiple years of sobriety and the tools of the program to try and get past this, just to survive.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Emotional/\u201cbig feewings\u201d contributions to this mess - \nThere is so much more to this story, including a diagnosis of ADHD in the last year (new meds, new hang ups, but never lost steam towards company goals), also going through a cancer scare earlier that same year (a little bit of what contributed to the burnout), and later finding it that my (married) boss was engaging in inappropriate relationships/an affair with another female employee who was a direct report to him (NOT me - she disclosed this to me after the fact, after she left the company voluntarily and after I was let go, but I am starting to see how he finally realized I wasn\u2019t going to worship him or fall into the same trap, and that he was losing his influence over me)\u2026 &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;this all contributed to my slow \u201cfalling out\u201d with him as I watched him change from a humble leader who I would\u2019ve almost considered a mentor and would\u2019ve \u201cprofessionally\u201d followed to the ends of the earth, to an alcohol-abusing shell of a person consumed by power, influence and salary, consistently disrespectful to anyone who disagreed with him, 99% of which were other females (and many of us went to HR about it, to no avail)\u2026 &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;this same person (again, my direct boss) KNEW I was in recovery from alcohol and encouraged me to drink at multiple work events over the years, which I never did\u2026 he would drunk text me at night (I have pictures of this), he put out pro-alcohol messages to our entire team, literally showing him drinking bourbon and MMM-mmm-mmming how good they were, literally said \u201cdon\u2019t you wish you had some\u201d in a video where he was drinking - not only as these triggerish for someone in recovery from alcohol, they are also just inappropriate in general in the workplace, I believe. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suspect, in the end, that he was frustrated that he was falling victim to the drink and I had found a way out, and miserable people don\u2019t like people with a solution\u2026 but these are just my thoughts. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019m sorry this post turned out so long. Again, ANY thoughts or help pointers would be so gratefully appreciated. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "confidence", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "bfaf55ca-0a83-11e6-b606-0e6c77463a9b", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhnd", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "1oc5hzq", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Internal_Rhubarb7711", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 4, "send_replies": true, "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/jobs/comments/1oc5hzq/got_fired_3_weeks_after_taking_fmla_seems/", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1oc5hzq/got_fired_3_weeks_after_taking_fmla_seems/", "subreddit_subscribers": 2441176, "created_utc": 1761027796.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "jobs", "selftext": "As the title says, got fired for the first time for not meeting job expectations for the first time in my life last week.

So even though on paper I have a 15min commute, there are multiple instances where I never get home at my normal time which most likely wont happen at the new job. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "confidence", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "fdc72fd0-05ac-11e6-b950-0ef0df358363", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhnd", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "1oc65h9", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "AggravatingLie23", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 3, "send_replies": true, "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/jobs/comments/1oc65h9/is_it_worth_it_to_increase_my_commute_by_30/", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1oc65h9/is_it_worth_it_to_increase_my_commute_by_30/", "subreddit_subscribers": 2441176, "created_utc": 1761030229.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "jobs", "selftext": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Sick of companies asking to upload a video", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Applications"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/jobs", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_1obveck", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 16, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_d6tb9bf2", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": true, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Applications", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 16, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/bdf-AA7GNUZOnuYchiQe8UooyT6ZKSlDpt6Vng99QpI.jpg", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "post_hint": "image", "content_categories": null, "is_self": false, "mod_note": null, "crosspost_parent_list": [{"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "recruitinghell", "selftext": "I am so sick and tired of companies asking to upload a video during the application process.

Education doesn't really match experience. Experience doesn't really match passion.\n\nI'm sure this is a pretty common sentiment among people my age, a quarter-life crisis of sorts, but I thought I'd head here and see if this community might have any suggestions for me.\n\nI have a weird (but not too left-field) mix of education and experience, I spent 18 -&gt; 25 at university, graduating with a bachelors, and masters in two different engineering disciplines (Aerospace/Systems &amp; Mechanical respectively) from middling ex-poly's in the UK, with an internship in the middle for good measure. I also completed the first year of a PhD (Civil/Fluid Mechanics) but due to low pay and lack of interest I dropped out and spent \\~3 years working as a Software Engineer in FinTech/Banking.\n\nI left that role earlier this year to spend some time travelling with my partner, and we're coming up on 6 months in Asia, and are due to head home next month as we didn't really find any pursuable opportunities out here (which is a shame, but kind of our fault for not looking more deeply into the visas we applied for, c'est la vie!).\n\nWhilst we've been travelling and sightseeing, I've had some time to think about what I might like to do job-wise upon my return, and to be honest, I can't seem to nail anything down.\n\nMy problem is that, I don't feel like I'm 'expert' enough in anything I've already done to think that I'm competent enough to interview for them again (I know, I know, typical imposter syndrome), nor am I completely convinced that anything I've already done is what I'd want to pursue going forward for the rest of my working life.\n\nI consider myself a bit of a 'jack of all trades, master of none' kind of person, picking stuff up relatively well on the fly, but also someone that could specialise in something if I found it interesting. That's kind of my problem though, I'm not sure I know what I find interesting. What I do know, is that I like the following:\n\n* Networking - I like to think of myself as having a knack for being personable, and helping drive some level of cohesion in groups and teams I've been a part of, which has been reflected in past PR's from previous managers. I've also attended some software development focussed networking events out here in Asia on my travels and have really enjoyed meeting people and hearing their ideas, as well as volunteering to help run events.\n* Helping people/being useful - Job fulfilment for me, at least in some small part, comes from helping people out. I want to feel like I've done something generally useful/productive.\n* Mentoring/advocating - At past jobs I've signed up to mentor (more) junior people in the organisations I've worked for, and giving advice as and when I feel I can help/generally looking out for them.\n* Problem solving - At my core, I think I just like engaging my brain day to day, I get a small high on the 'eureka' moments, and would like some opportunity to chase that feeling of solving/fixing/building something.\n* Entrepreneurialism - During my time in Asia I've also attended events for startup founders etc, and I feel like that ignited something (admittedly small, but possibly worth pursuing) in me.\n* Financial tracking/research - No idea why, but I've always been pretty hot on making sure my own finances are in order, using spreadsheets, predicting future costs etc to make sure I know where everything's going, and making sure it's working for me as well as I'm able. I also love researching into things before I buy them to make sure I'm getting as good a deal as I can.\n* Travelling - I'm sure some people get sick of travelling for work, but I love seeing new stuff and experiencing new places, even if it does come with the expectation of doing work whilst I'm there.\n* Learning new things/how things work/repairing/tinkering\n\nMy mind has gone in a few different directions with this, and with my experience, education and 'likes' in mind:\n\n* Car Mechanic/Shop Owner - I've always loved tinkering and mucking around in engine bays, getting my hands dirty. There's also something fulfilling to me about being able to keep my own stuff going by myself.\n* Other entrepreneurial endeavour - I'd have to come up with an idea in the first place, but I feel like I could execute on it *if* I could think of something to pursue.\n* Tech sales - I feel like this hits a lot of my experience and some of my likes. Maybe I'd get that eureka kick from closing deals? Who knows.\n* Robotics - I feel like this would mix my experience and education well, and possibly hit some of my 'likes' if I chose the right role. Again though, I'm not sure if that would scratch the itch/be fulfilling, but I'd be open to at least looking for those roles.\n* Aerospace/Systems/Mechanical/Software Engineering - Going back to what I know, hopefully with some hope of getting into a managerial position.\n\nMy question for r/jobs then, is which of the above fits the bill the best from the outside looking in? and if there's something more niche you can think that I haven't, that would fit my odd list of education/experience/likes, what would it be?
