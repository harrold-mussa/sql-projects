After some initial confusion, USCIS clarified that it would only apply to new applicants, not existing H-1Bs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Today, &lt;a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/stuartanderson/2025/10/20/immigration-service-issues-guidance-on-who-pays-the-100000-h-1b-fee/\"&gt;USCIS released new guidance&lt;/a&gt; clarifying that the fee will also not apply to &amp;quot;change of status&amp;quot; applicants, such as F1 to H1B. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since almost all H-1Bs come in as bachelors or masters students on F1 -&amp;gt; OPT on F1 -&amp;gt; H-1B, for all practical purposes this almost reverses the 100k fee. It now only applies to people applying for jobs in the US from outside of the US.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;International students return to their previous level of difficulty applying.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "05438160-1232-11e5-b573-0e1422b8b60b", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sdpm", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "1obvtle", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "OpenConference3", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 41, "send_replies": true, "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1obvtle/uscis_updates_h1b_100k_fee_good_news_for_intl/", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1obvtle/uscis_updates_h1b_100k_fee_good_news_for_intl/", "subreddit_subscribers": 2281682, "created_utc": 1760999135.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "cscareerquestions", "selftext": "Can\u2019t wait to start my new gig at Apple and use my experience to reach AGI!", "author_fullname": "t2_8mqoj9o4", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Laid off from CrowdStrike and AWS, now finally got an offer from Siri team", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/cscareerquestions", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_1obj40s", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 231, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": null, "can_mod_post": false, "score": 231, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1760967216.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.cscareerquestions", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can\u2019t wait to start my new gig at Apple and use my experience to reach AGI!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sdpm", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "1obj40s", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Berson14", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 22, "send_replies": true, "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1obj40s/laid_off_from_crowdstrike_and_aws_now_finally_got/", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1obj40s/laid_off_from_crowdstrike_and_aws_now_finally_got/", "subreddit_subscribers": 2281682, "created_utc": 1760967216.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "cscareerquestions", "selftext": "Title.

I finished a 6-month internship at Omnishore, where I worked on a big insurance platform using .NET 8, Angular 19, SQL Server, and CQRS / Clean Architecture. It was tough, but I learned a lot and thought it would open doors.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After that, I got accepted for a pre-employment internship at Prestige, moved to another city, paid for transport and a gym, even started building a new routine\u2026 and then, out of nowhere, they told me they\u2019re overstaffed.\nNow they\u2019re offering two options:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Work remotely for free for 3 months until a post is open, or&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Come on-site full-time with no clear contract yet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Honestly, I feel crushed. I\u2019ve already been through this once \u2014 Omnishore also didn\u2019t hire me after promising there was a chance. I\u2019ve been trying hard to stay disciplined, rebuild my life, go to the gym, focus on my health and confidence\u2026 but I keep ending up back at zero.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know I\u2019m not the only one struggling to find a junior dev job, but I feel completely drained. I\u2019m trying to stay calm, rebuild, and not lose faith, but it\u2019s really hard when every opportunity collapses last minute.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If anyone here has been through this \u2014 how did you keep going?\nHow do you rebuild your motivation after months of rejection and uncertainty?\nAny advice for someone who just wants a stable start and peace of mind?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "05438160-1232-11e5-b573-0e1422b8b60b", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sdpm", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "1obj462", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "TENETREVERSED", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 7, "send_replies": true, "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1obj462/how_do_you_even_recover_from_this/", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1obj462/how_do_you_even_recover_from_this/", "subreddit_subscribers": 2281682, "created_utc": 1760967225.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}], "before": null}}
