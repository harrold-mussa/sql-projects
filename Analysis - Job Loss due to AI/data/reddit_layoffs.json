Expect a wave of layoffs no matter what is going on in politics. Don\u2019t panic, just get prepared.**\n\n\n## Financial Preparation\n\nEven a 1 month emergency fund helps. Reevaluate your spending and cut back. You don\u2019t need every streaming subscription. Share and cancel what you can. What would your grandma say if she saw you ordering $40 McDonald\u2019s from DoorDash?\n\nBe mindful of holiday spending. Avoid buying stuff no one needs. An expensive new gadget isn\u2019t worth missing a bill if you lose a paycheck.\n\n## Save Your Documents\n\nGet your personal files off of your work device *now.* Save a copy of anything that wouldn\u2019t violate your NDA. Performance reviews, work samples, insurance docs, your contracts.\n\n## Update Your Resume\n\nYou\u2019re doing your end of year review anyway, update your resume and LinkedIn. Highlight new skills and accomplishments.\n\n## Use Your Benefits\n\nIf you haven\u2019t this year, get a checkup. Use Urgent Care if your PCP is booked.\n\nIf your job allows an annual stipend for anything, training, wellness, tech, use it now before it goes away.\n\n## Build Your Network\n\nReaching out to people only when you need something doesn\u2019t build connections. Send a few friendly messages to people in your network. See what they're working on and offer help where you can. Add the coworkers you like and work well with to your LinkedIn now. You\u2019re creating a support network that will be there when you need it.\n\n---\n\n### Just Got Laid Off?\n\nSorry friend. Those bastards really suck.\n\n## Health Insurance\n\nCOBRA is expensive but may make sense if you\u2019ve met your deductible this year. Otherwise, check Healthcare.gov for cheaper ACA plans. You generally have 60 days from job loss to enroll.\n\n## File for Unemployment\n\nEvery state runs its own unemployment program so they can varies widely. You can [find yours State's unemployment program here](https://www.careeronestop.org/LocalHelp/UnemploymentBenefits/find-unemployment-benefits.aspx) or try asking in your state's sub.\n\nIf you\u2019re unsure if you're eligible, apply anyway. Filling out the form will tell you if you qualify. Waiting only delays your benefits.\n\n## Public Assistance  (No Shame)\n\nYou pay your taxes to have these programs. All you're doing is getting your money back. Look up [Benefits.gov](http://www.Benefits.gov) for food, rent, and utility help. Most states also have assistance and [211.org](http://www.211.org) can connect you to local programs.\n\n## Organize Your Finances\n\nSet a Budget NOW. No more eating out. No more deliveries. You have the free time to do your own shopping and cooking now. Cancel subscriptions. **Keep life insurance.** Home Economy is your new job.\n\n## Organize Your Time\n\nSet a routine. Don\u2019t sleep till noon. Establish a wake-up time, hit the gym, spend some time in the sun, and dedicate a few focused hours to job searching. Have an end time. Schedule social activities that don\u2019t require spending. Don\u2019t isolate yourself.\n\nGet a certificate or credential. Show you were doing something during your resume gap.\n\nSet up job alerts. Receive relevant job openings in your inbox, so you can apply quickly.\n\nConsider volunteering. It can keep your skills fresh, expand your network, and fill a gap on your resume. **Doing esteemable acts increases self-esteem.**\n\n## Organize Your Job Search\n\nTrack applications in a spreadsheet. Log jobs you\u2019ve applied for, interview dates, contacts, and follow-up reminders in a spreadsheet to keep you organized and help identify patterns in your applications. You\u2019ll also avoid accidentally applying to the same position twice and know who to badmouth for posting ghost jobs.\n\n## Time for an Update\n\nEspecially for workers over 40. Do spend *some* money wisely on looking sharp for job interviews. Get a haircut, beard trim, updated glasses. Go for a facial, even if you\u2019re a man. You don't need a whole new wardrobe, just a few new pieces. Hit the gym. 50 and well put together is perceived entirely differently from 50 and has let themselves go, no matter how good your skills are.\n\n## Tap Your Network\n\nLet your network know you\u2019re on the hunt. Before applying, check if you know anyone inside the company that can refer you. Who you know is important.\n\n## Use the WARN Act Period Wisely\n\nIf you qualify for the [WARN Act](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/eta/layoffs/warn), you are still technically an employee. Make use of your health insurance and benefits. Start job hunting now. Onboarding takes time and your WARN period is likely to be over by a new start date.\n\n## Stay Calm\n\nIt takes time to land a new job. Even fast processes can mean 1-3 months without a paycheck. Stressing won\u2019t help, but remember the pain of this experience so you learn not to let it happen unprepared again.\n\n## Consider a Pivot\n\nWere you wanting to get out of this career anyway? Now might be the time.\n\nNeed work *now?* Try seasonal roles in warehouses, delivery driving, or even tax prep. Demand often spikes in these fields during winter.\n\nLooking for a whole new career?  Check out the [Fastest Growing Occupations](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/fastest-growing.htm). Don't go back to school and get into more debt without a planning what you will do with it.\n\n## Gig Economy\n\nBefore diving into gig work, remember that the pay might look higher than it is. Gig work looks lucrative until you subtract gas, maintenance, and taxes. Track every dollar. Don\u2019t end up with a big unexpected tax bill at the end of the year.\n\nSites like Fiverr, Upwork, and TaskRabbit offer contract work that can provide a little extra income. If you have a marketable skill, such as graphic design, writing, or even handyman skills, you can bring in some income while job hunting. Again, remember to take out taxes.\n\nNo shame in a bridge job. If you need to take a role that pays less than your last job, take it and bring in income while you keep looking. It's still forward motion.\n\n## Avoid Burnout\n\n[Exercise performs as well as antidepressants](https://www.bmj.com/content/384/bmj-2023-075847) for most cases of depression, without side effects.\n\nIf you're unable to afford a gym membership, look for body weight, functional fitness, and/or HIIT workouts on Youtube. Do them outside in the sun. Make your neighbors jealous of that cake.\n\nThere\u2019s a reason every major religion has a Sabbath. Set a day each week to step away from job boards, emails, and social media. Leave the screens at home and go outside. Be active. Be social. Live.\n\n---\n\n\n**What advice would you add to this list?
